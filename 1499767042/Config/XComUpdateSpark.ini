; Set this to true if your Schematic Merges are not working properly, then close and reopen XCOM 2.
; On loading a game, if this is true, your inventory will be scanned for items and then the linked
; SPARK items will be spawned. This does take into account the other settings below!
; For example, if this is set to true and you have a Mag Cannon but not a Helix Autocannon,
; then it will be granted to you if SPARK_OVERHAUL_WEAPON is set to true.

; Should the Improved Cannons breakthrough benefit the SPARK Autocannon as well?
; Disable if you have a mod that gives SPARKs their own breakthroughs
SPARK_CANNON_BREAKTHROUGH=true

; Should the SPARK autocannon get upgraded along with the grenadier's autocannon schematics?
SPARK_OVERHAUL_WEAPON=true
; If false, the autocannon will have its own Magnetic and Beam schematics, adjustable here: (these are the vanilla values, and they're ridiculous. I highly suggest you make them much cheaper.)
