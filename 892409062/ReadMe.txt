This mod adds a variety of cosmetics for T3 armor, including new helmets, new face props and new armor pieces.

Features 10+ new face/head props and 25+ new armor pieces.
Also features a couple of variants where you cannot apply camo to the "rigging"

Personally i never disliked the look of the T3 armor, with the exception of two things, the armor looks too clean and shiny for what is supposed to be armor made by a resistance group with no resources, and that it was too plain compared to the T1 and T2 armors. So with this mod i tried to address thaose issues, the Anarchy's Children DLC already added a weathered gritty version for the T3 armors, but not everyone owns the DLC and you can't modify DLC assets(not to my knowledged at least), so first i made a retexture of the warden armor, it's not as weathered and gritty as the anarchy children's version and you cannot recolor the lights on the armor, so it's different. Secondly, i made a variety of "tacticool" accessories for the armor, like a large variety of pouches so you can disguise your soldiers as 90s Cable.

How to acquire and miscellaneous information:

All the helmets and face props should be available from the start.
Armor cosmetics can only be chosen if you have warden armor or the Wraith Suit equiped.
The mod now includes a hood, the hood is available in all 3 head slots, however, a couple of the Wraith Suit armor pieces come with the hood integrated on the torso piece.

Known issues:

Weapons like the sword and grenade launcher clip with the power pack on the back of the suit. I don't believe it's possible to fix this without messing(and probably breaking) the animations when a soldier goes to pick the weapon, so unfortunately it'll stay as is.

Heavy Weapon doesn't get a new texture so it clashes with the look of the new textured suits. There are a couple of reasons why i didn't make a new texture for the heavy weapon, the first one being that for the most part i'm not sure how to replace the texture of an existing asset without making a duplicate, the traditional way assuming it works the same way in this game as in other games(like TES games) would make it so that you need to make sure this mod always loads last in the load order to keep it, which would make it a pain and possibly conflict with other mods, the other way would be to make an actual duplicate weapon which would cause all manners of conflicts with other mods.

Compatibility:

Should be compatible with everything.

To do list:

Nothing.

Permisions:
