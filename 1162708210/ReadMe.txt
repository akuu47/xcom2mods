ADVENT Future Complete AI Pack is a complete rework of the base game AI. The goal of the mod is to make enemies as smart as possible and to provide extra challenge to players who find the base game AI too simple. This pack covers the entire ADVENT troops, and some XCOM base units.

-= REQUIREMENTS =-
While technically not required, it goes hand in hand with Blessings of the Elders and Wrath of the Chosen.
The other requirements are real requirements, they are expected or units could act weird.

-= COMPATIBILITY =-
Do not use this mod with any base game retool, this pack is meant to be used with a standard WOTC installation, and some mods here and there. If you have any mods that add special enemies or changes the behavior of units, they are mostly likely not compatible.
