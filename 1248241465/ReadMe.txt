Every grenade you put into your inventory now gives you two grenades to throw or launch in combat.
This stacks with a grenadier's bonus from heavy ordnance, so you'll have four grenades in that slot.
For added grenade fun, it also removes the limitation on carrying more than one utility grenade per soldier.

If you find this slightly overpowered to give to all classes, you can instead only give bonus grenades to grenadiers. (Or whomever)
To do that, edit XComMoreGrenades.ini and set OnlyOneClass to true. You can also change the class that gets the bonus.
