DESCRIPTION
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
The mod adds some light armors from the fantastic work of [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/kexx4556/myworkshopfiles/?appid=268500] [GWJ]Kexx[/url]. The only purpose of this mod is to fix the position of the guns in the models of the armors. Though it may be also useful if you just only want to have all the cool clothes and not the character faces of the original mods.
 
This is a problem related with the animations of the armor models, and all mods i have seen with custom armors or torsos which don't have the same size as the Vanilla ones, have this problem. 
The explanation of how to implement this fix in [url=http://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/1058613340/2217311444334872919/] Link to the Discussion[/url].

Only the clothes of the original mods have been included in this mod, so it does not replace the original ones.

The models used in this work are taken from the Mass Effect and StarCraft game Series, all the modeling work should be attributed to [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/kexx4556/myworkshopfiles/?appid=268500] [GWJ]Kexx[/url]. If you like anything about this mod, you should check all the fantastic job he does.

[h1] Compatibility: [/h1] 
- This mod only adds esthetic props. It is fully Compatible with LW2, and all DLCs. 
- The original mods from [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/kexx4556/myworkshopfiles/?appid=268500] [GWJ]Kexx[/url] may overlap with this one, if you don't see the armors fixed try to unsubscribe from the original mods. You can probably keep both versions functioning, if you make sure this mod overwrites the original and not the other way around.

[h1] Update(15-08-2017): [/h1] 
- I created custom animations for the skeletal meshes so now the Grenade launcher fits better and the psiamp has mostly no clipping anymore. 

[h1] Issues: [/h1] 
- Currently there is still a minimun clipping with the PsiAmp, even after the update. Fix this requires trial and error editing of evey armor, i just fixed the thing the best i could till i got tired :).
- Since the poses are a bit bugged and change the positions of the guns, the granade launcher does not fit perfeclty.

[h1] Future: [/h1] 
- This mod will become obsolete as soon as [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/kexx4556/myworkshopfiles/?appid=268500] [GWJ]Kexx[/url] decides we wants to fix the original mods (But I will probably keep it in the workshop to avoid ruining your Character Pools).

[h1] Other Mods: [/h1] 
- I have also implemented a fix of the locked civilian armors of the game, and some uniforms from MGSV in another mod [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1058613340] Fixed Light Armors[/url].
