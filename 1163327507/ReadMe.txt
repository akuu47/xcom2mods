About this mod

First of all, this mod will be getting occasional extra looks for the lost from time to time when i find something new i like (or you guys recommend something in the comments thats worth doing)

As a MAJOR fan of the zombie movie genre we came up with this little mod changing the Lost into a more "Zombie" like experience, adding new game play mechanics and looks to the existing pool of lost

We tried to implement stuff from both old school zombie movies as well as modern infected / zombie movies and / or tv shows.

We tried to make the whole experience more challenging (Deadlier??? :p ) from mid to late game.

Mod does NOT require new game to work

As always we hope you guys like the mod, and please leave thumbs up if you do

ATTENTION
This mod now supports MCM and will highly recommend using that mod for easy configuration of the look of the lost


Feature list
New units
Lost brute (our version, not the vanilla version)
note.. we are currently working on a possible way of disabeling the new Brute via MCM in case some people don't like the unit.
Introducing the Lost Brute. 
The Brute is highly mutated from the pods left in the abandoned cities. Brutes are a bit slower than other lost but have more HP. The Early game Brute starts out at 10HP and the late game Brute will max out at 26HP. In all stages of the game, the Brutes more than likely will not go down with 1 hit but will take 2 to 3 at most. They hit harder than other Lost and the mid game Brute gains 1 armor where as the late game Brute gains 2 armor. They can break through walls and when damage is dealt to them, their boils will burst spraying poison gas in a 2 tile radius around them. They however DO NOT explode on death. They do not spawn often and spawn rates are comparable to the Lost Boomers from ABA. In test missions, "on average" we seen 2 out of every 60 to 70 lost. THIS WILL VARY!!

ATTENTION.. The Brute is NOT affected by the card "Between the eyes"

Game play changes

* Any humanoid killed by the lost will rise as a "Lost zombie"

* New Lost Zombies when raised will spawn with +10 defense

* Base Lost gained +1 mobility

* Lost Dashers gained +5 Defense and +5 dodge to represent them being harder to hit from "Dashing" and they can now wall climb.

* All Lost got an increase to damage output by +1 damage

* Lost Brutes have been renamed Howlers and have gained +10 defense and now have Howl which is a (one time use per Howler) If multiple Howlers are on the map, there is a 3 turn global cooldown so they can not spam the Howl. Howl works the same way any other noise does. They Howl, it draws a swarm closer. But will not draw a swarm right away unless other noise before the howl had already drawn a swarm closer. 

* Lost Corpses can now be sold in the Black Market for 1 per corpse

* Flavor loot has been added and most of the items can be sold for a small amount at the black market, 
although some really rare items can be sold for quite a lot to collectors at the black market

* A very small amount of the lost now carry actual useful items like ammo and med kits

Visual changes
Fixed flyover text for "howl ability"
Renamed reanimated advent / XCOM soldiers to "Lost Zombies"


Overrides :
X2Action_MoveClimbWall (This WILL give a false positive in the alternative mod launcher if you have other mods that uses the same override, but just ignore that)

Compatibility issues:
None that i am aware of
SHOULD be compatible with ABA


ToDo

Create new bite animation to replace MeleeAttackA

Add more different looks for the lost, including xcom soldier uniforms from EW (minimum 15 in total)

Known conflicts
Additional Enemy Perks
