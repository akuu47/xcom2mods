A series of facepaints to enrich your XCOM 2 experience, by [RQ]StuballZ / eldritch68.

This pack came about primarily from a desire to have faces to match some of the great voicepacks floating around, namely Cortana, GladOS, and my own SHODAN. I originally wanted to give them a sort of 'flesh collar', as if they were wearing human skin like a onesie. Alas, there's so much stretching going on in the textures of the neck that it was just impossible to get a clean line, and they just look like plain ol' facepaints.

Cheetah Facepaint with Leopard Spot Tattoo: Cheetah faces are cool but their spots are boring. Leopard faces are boring but their spots are cool. Why not have the best of both?

Cortana: Cortana was actually really, really tough to get right. I still don't feel she's as good as I can make her -- she kind of looks like she's wearing a coloured hessian bag on her face. But this was the best I could do without an animated texture. Cortana is owned by Microsoft, the poor thing. Goes well with any of the Cortana voicepacks available on the Steam Workshop.

Death comes in many forms (see what I did there?). Eyeliner only, eyeliner with facepaint, eyeliner with skull facepaint. So far my daughter's guinea pig is still alive, so I'm hoping Death was pleased by the results. Oh, and she has an Ankh tattoo.

Futurist: I fully expect you all to cringe from this garish monstrosity and demand its removal. I was trying to do something cyberpunky, Deus-Exy.

Luxur: Inspired by ancient Egyptian makeup, which I've always had a thing for.

GlaDOS: I love this character (I like to think of her as SHODAN's little sister) and have often thought of designing a humanoid version of her. Early designs were a little too clownish; this was a little more clean and restrained, and I felt a good representation of her character and design asthetic. Goes well with Walker Texas Ranger's GlaDOS voicepack, downloadable on the Steam Workshop. GlaDOS and the Aperture Science logo is owned by Valve.

SHODAN: Ah, SHODAN. I love her unreservedly and unapologetically. This facepaint was lovingly hand-crafted by me using only the old System Shock 2 wallpaper as reference. Goes well with my SHODAN voicepack, available here:

Includes two Tri.Optimum tattoos, a logo version and a sleeve. I co-opted one of the game's native sleeves to assist with the latter, and made use of BrushEezy's Iron Man brushes, available here: http://www.brusheezy.com/brushes/18478-iron-man-brushes. SHODAN was created by Looking Glass Studios, and is now owned by Otherside Entertainment and Night Dive Studios. Who else is looking forward to System Shock 3? F**k yeah!

SIRIUS: Inspired by an old comic book series called 'Six From Sirius' by, if memory serves, Doug Moench and Paul Gulacy, and published by Epic Comics.

SPHINX: Taken from a character named Rrliss in my own indie comic book Preyground, which you can see more of here: http://moriadat.deviantart.com/gallery/8327034/Preyground-webcomic

TIGER and ZEBRA are both pretty self-explanatory, and have accompanying stripey tattoos.

MINSC: The face tattoo belonging to the irascible ranger Minsc from the Baldur's Gate series, to complement the voicepack already on the Steam Workshop.

DOOMSDAY WARRIOR: A Mad Max-styled facepaint utilizing one of LongQuattro's tyre tread patterns, from Shutterstock.

WAR BOY: My daughter's suggestion - the War Boys from Mad Max: Fury Road.

AZTECH: A perverse marriage of the Tron design aesthetic and the Aztec culture.

PSI WARRIOR SUITE: I felt I had a little more to say with the whole PSI Warrior concept, and explored it a little more fully, using even more of Obsidian Dawn's Arcane Circles brushes. More of Obsidian Dawn's excellent brushes may be found here:

CORTANA v2.0 and SHODAN v2.0: Just a little experiment to try and bring back the original 'human skin onesie' concept. Cortana's skin is intended to look artificial; SHODAN's is intended to look real, bruised and jaundiced and raw around the edges, with green lights shining through here and there. She spent half of System Shock 2 discussing how disgusting human flesh was, so it's unlikely she'd take care of it if she had to wear it.
