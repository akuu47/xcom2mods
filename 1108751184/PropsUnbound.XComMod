Title=Props Unbound
Description=Adds most props to all three prop categories, so you can wear your eyepatch as a "helmet" or your goggles as a "Lower Face" prop. Also affects Capnbub's Accessories, letting you wear the forehead versions of the Ballistic and Night Vision Goggles as upper or lower face props.
