[h1]Primary Pistols and Primary Melee Weapons[/h1]

Update: Now features dedcated animations for primary swords, primary pistols and primary autopistols.
This includes tactical animations, armory animations, starting screen, skyranger drop and photobooth poses.

Requires War of the Chosen Expansion and the WotC Community Highlander.

Please don't use this together with my "Primary Pistols" mod. The mods collide with each other.

This mod generates primary variants of all pistols and melee weapons in the game.

They are unlocked together with their secondary counterpart.

It supports all DLC and XPack weapons and every melee weapon or pistol of any mod,
since the the primary weapons are generated at game initializtion from whatever you have installed.

Additionally this mod incorporates the Pistol Upgrades mod which means it adds
visual attachments for the vanilla pistols (primary and secondary).

Primary Pistols have a clip size of 6
and they provide +1 mobility and -20% detection radius and +1 damage and a slightly better range table than secondary pistols(can be disabled or modified in XComPrimarySecondaries.ini).

Also adds a "Empty secondary" item that grants a 15% mobility bonus.

Specialist, Grenadier and PsiOperative are enabled to use primary melee weapons, primary pistols and templar sidearms.
Sharpshooter can use primary melee weapons and Rangers Primary Pistols/Sidearms.
This is not fully tested and could be buggy for abilities like supression e.g. Feedback is welcome.
Also you can't use ranged abilities with swords of course.

Credits to:
Krakah for the pistol attachments.

Incompatibilities:
Reduce Armory Clutter causes this mod not to work properly.
Some mod added weapons have no fireing sound. Please ask the mod author of these mods to put the sound in the weapon animation.
