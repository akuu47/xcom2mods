UNINSTALL INSTRUCTIONS
1. Delete the folder from your XCOM 2/XComGame/Mods/ folder
2. Sometimes the game does not remove config settings properly upon uninstalling. To get around this you need to open your: 
Documents/my games/XCOM2/XComGame/Config/XComContent.ini 
and replace:
ColorPaletteInfo=(Palette=ePalette_HairColor,ArchetypeName="Expandedhaircolors.HairColor")
with
ColorPaletteInfo=(Palette=ePalette_HairColor,ArchetypeName="X2_UnitPalettes.HairColor")
