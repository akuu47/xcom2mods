[list]
     [*]Resistance members during the haven assault will use the AK (Tier 1), X-9 Assault Rifle (Tier 2), and the TLE Laser Rifle (Tier 3).

[h1][b]KNOWN ISSUES[/b][/h1]
[list]
     [*]Dunno if the new Militia unit actually appears. You might end up with the AK throughout the entire campaign.
