[h1]Release #34[/h1]
Mod ID: 1586643354
[h1]WOTC ONLY[/h1]


There's plenty of Soldier Armor and Tacti-cool Cosmetic Mods out there, but not nearly enough
civilian looks. This mod aims to remedy that by adding a whopping 137 different customizable 
items, ranging from ragtag looks to more casual fare, and everything in between!

[h1]In this Pack you will find the following:[/h1]

30 Torsos
19 Legs
88 Props (includes L/R Arms, Scars, Facepaints, and every conceivable customization slot)

For maximum customizability, I have added same items in different categories. This means for
example, you will find the "Aviators on Forehead" under Helmets, Upper Face Props and Lower
Face Props. You will find the "Drum Jacket" under Torso Deco, L and R Arm Decos. 

If you find this method clutters your lists or spawns horrible looking rookies, instructions
on how to add and remove items can be found in the ReadMe, as well as inside each of the
3 individual XComContent.ini files; Torso Pack, Leg Pack and Props Pack folders.

You can find them here: ...Steam Games/steamapps/workshop/content/268500/1586643354/Config

Keep in mind, every item has been re-fitted and re-rigged to xcom proportions, and with only
a handful of particulars, the vast majority of items work in beautiful harmony. All Jackets
and Decos fit over most Torsos. That said, I am not a professional, so please excuse some very, 
very minor clipping on a few of these.

[h1]Please keep in mind, these are for Female soldiers only.
There are currently no plans for a Male Pack.[/h1]
