Rookies use Resistance armor by default. 

Gives a sense of the "just starting out" - using scrap armor, and of character progession. 
I suggest not using the 'advanced' ( game default) professional-looking Kevlar Armor outfit until you have the ability to build Nanoscale ( whether you do or not ) for consistency. ( of course, we don't customize until squaddie or corporal - gotta earn it ).ou created an XCOM 2 Mod Project!
