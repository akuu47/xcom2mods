For some reason unbeknowest to us, some packages (FX_, dev packages, clearcoat) are not loaded in WotC, or rather, do not exist at all, breaking a lot of mods that use Particle Systems. This is [B][I]intentional[/I][/B] to reduce the size of WotC.

This will be required for any mod that uses Particle Systems, which is any mod that adds new aliens or ADVENT like the Advent Pathfinder mod or weapons as such as the weapon megapack or Mercenary Plasma Weapons.

This mod also contains fixes for the following mods:
[list]
     [*]Highbob's Not So Super Soldier mod (fixes the blackface Central and Tygan heads).
     [*]Mercy, Tracer, and Genji Squadmate mods (missing necessary MorphTargetSet).
     [*]All weapon mods.
     [*]Mods that use ClearCoat_CP.
[/list]

If you have any other packages that you want loaded, then post in the discussion section.
