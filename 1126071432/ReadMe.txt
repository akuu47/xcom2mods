SMG-series weapon mod for XCOM2
By Long War Studios

This mod will add three new submachine gun-type weapons, one for each of the three weapon tech levels (ballistic, magnetic, plasma). 

They offer bonus mobility, concealment and close-range accuracy, at a penalty to damage and long-range accuracy relative to the assault rifle.
