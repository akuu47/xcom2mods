[h1][b]War of the Chosen version![/b][/h1]

This mod adds several Balaclavas from the infamous title, Call of Duty: Ghosts. This should work with all vanilla faces.

[b]If anyone wants to help port the hero or any other uniforms, or accelerate the rate that we get more content, feel free to get in touch with me. I really just need more skinners/riggers that are able to rig uniforms to XCOM 2.[/b]
