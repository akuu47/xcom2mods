Sorry for this mess I have made.

=======================================

[h1]What is this mod?[/h1]

A utility mod that allows you to hide accessories of the hero units to make full body cosmetic mods look better. This can also make modders' work easier, depending on what they're trying to achieve.

It works similarly to the Invisible Head mod, simply select the hidden body part from the corresponding slots and you're set.

[h1]Q&A[/h1]

Q: How can I hide the gauntlet/ripjacks on Templars/Skirmishers?
A: These are weapons, not armour parts. You'll need to wait for someone to make an invisible gauntlet/ripjack mod.

Q: How can I hide xxxx on my XCOM soldiers?
A: You might need [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1127014384] Empty WOTC Deco Slots for XCOM Soldiers [/url] for that.

[b][h1]I want to report bugs or give suggestions![/h1][/b]
If you're experiencing problems or want to post suggestions, please provide the following:
 The exact cosmetic mod you're trying to apply to your soldier. ( e.g. Kexx's Palaven mod.)
 The class of your solder ( e.g. a Reaper)
 The effect you want to achieve ( e.g. "Make a badass Turian soldier but without the shoulder pauldrons." )
 The problem you're having ( e.g. "but I can't hide the pauldrons, there is no option for it!")
 A screenshot if possible.

This will greatly help me nail down the problem because I can't test all the cosmetic mod out there and I can't try out all the cases in my limited time. I need your help to make this mod better so don't be afraid of nagging me :)

The outfits showed in the screenshot is from [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1125578849]E3245's MGSV Jungle Fatigues.[/url] and [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1128988960]Kexx's Palaven mod[/url] Check it out!

[b] The only feature missing here is the invisible head for Skirmishers (the original Invisible Head mod works fine for Reaper and Templar). Any capable modders out there who can make this happen?[/b]
