Do you always avoid buildings out of fear of blowing your cover?
Too worried of lurking civilians and pods to enter that back alley?
Do you feel a twinge of fear whenever you approach the edge of a roof or skylight?
Sick of "stealthing" your way through the map by running through the center of the road?
Then this mod might be for you.


This mod makes concealment more reasonable and forgiving in low-sight situations.

* Peeking ("stepping-out") from behind high cover does not break concealment.  Blind corners are safe to approach and even to retreat from.

* Approaching the edge of a rooftop, or peeking into a skylight, is now safe.

* Close-range ambushes are easier and more flexible when you have access to doors, windows, and other high cover.


Curious as to how this works?  Here are the rules:

* You cannot be revealed by an enemy if you have high cover against it, or low cover with elevation (eg. on a rooftop)

* Movement is slightly more forgiving.  If the start and end of your move are hidden, you won't be revealed unless you are visible on at 3 tiles of your movement path.  

In exchange for these bonuses, enemy detection ranges have been buffed slightly, making open areas and roads a bit more dangerous.

All of this stuff is configurable in the INI.
