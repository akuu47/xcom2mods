[/list]

Release ver: 1.123:
[list]
     [*]If the Lost & Abandonded narrative is enabled, then the Prison Break mission will be disabled until Mox is rescued, to prevent duplication bugs and other weird behavior.
	 [*]Changed the algorithm of the spawning location. It now spawns from the prisoners centerpoint that is obtained in the beginning of the mission, with a ranged distance of [32, 48] tiles to prevent spawning on the building.
[/list]

Release ver: 1.122:

     [*]Fixed a bug where the Evac Zone marker does not get removed once the Skyranger leaves.

[/list]

Release ver: 1.110:
[list]
     [*]Added the ability to configure all aspects of the Covert Action, from Staff Slots, to Optional Costs, to Risks.
[/list]

Release ver: 1.100:
[list]
     [*]Added Variety 01 mission chance for Covert Action reward. If the number of captured soldiers is less than 8, then the CA will instead generate Variety 01 which is a highly configurable mission where there's a chance for no reward (All this can be changed in this mod's XComGameData.ini). Otherwise, the standard 6 prisoner mission is picked.
	 [*]Added Faction soldiers and other Staff (scientist and engineers) as rewards for rescuing them for both Variety 01 and the Standard mission.
[/list]
