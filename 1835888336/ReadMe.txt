[h1][b]FAQ[/b][/h1]

[b][u]1. Level with me. Do I really, really, really need to sub to the CHL? [/u][/b]
- Yes.

[b][u]2. How come you decided to release the Mod in it's alpha stage? Wouldn't it be better to have a better sense of completion before release? [/u][/b]
- These take a really long time to get right. The amount of face bones that need to be re-painted is astounding and daunting. Probably why I'm the only one that's done so. Getting to a "more complete" state might take too long, and I might burn out completely, and no one wants that. This allows the community to start enjoying these new heads immediately while I work on more.

[b][u]3. Ada Wong is not Caucasian!! She's Asian!! What are you, stupid???!!! STOOPID!!! [/u][/b]
- Let's talk about the Elephant in the room. I have never played a RE game in my life. My first contact with the existence of Ada, was from RE6. After some research, yes, she is indeed Asian, and in pretty much every single other RE game, she continues to be. Yet, specifically in RE6, the mesh they went with looks, to me, caucasian. Even more so after I finished working on her.

[b][u]4. And Zafina isn't Hispanic, she's from Egypt! [/u][/b]
- Hispanic is simply the template nomenclature used in XCOM2's coding, so you'll know where to find them. But this race refers to Hispanic, Latin, South Asian, Middle Eastern and Mediterranean. Pretty much all your Olive Skin toned races.

[b][u]5. Uh...no new African faces? [/u][/b]
- In the works!

[b][u]6. Uh...no dudes? Again? [/u][/b]
- You've obviously noticed a trend. But Male Faces are in the plans. All I ask is patience, these take a long time to get right.

[b][u]7. Facepaints and scars aren't aligned right. What gives?[/u][/b]
- You're welcomed to learn about Retopology and UV coordinate editing.

[b][u]8. I'm seeing holes, seams and some texture anomalies. Thoughts? [/u][/b]
- Repeat after me; Work. In. Progress.

[b][u]9. Are you gonna add your 3 Asari faces to this?[/u][/b]
- Maybe? Would be nice to have them as actual Heads, and be rid of Invisible Heads for good. I suppose if enough people request them.

[b][u]10. I hate you and everything you stand for, but I still wanna throw some money your way. How? [/u][/b]
- Thanks! I really do appreciate it, but honestly, I do this because I love XCom, nothing more. Besides, I'm no modeller, these are ports, and I can't profit from work that's not my own. Just take pictures of your squad!
