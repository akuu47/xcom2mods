**UPDATED FOR WOTC REAPER/SKIRMISHER/TEMPLAR CHARACTERS

NOBLE TEAM voice pack. This is just a collection of all of my standalone Noble voices. For convenience sake. All audio ripped and slightly EQ'd and normalized from the Halo Reach game files.

I'll leave the individual Noble Team voice clips up but I'll only be updating this package.

7 Voices, Six is male/female.
Roughly 500 clips for each voice, except for six which uses 100 or so for each gender.

I've given priority (aka the best lines) to specific classes:

NOBLE ONE = RANGER
NOBLE TWO = SPECIALIST
NOBLE THREE = SHARPSHOOTER
NOBLE FOUR = RANGER
NOBLE FIVE = GRENADIER
NOBLE SIX = GENERIC (aka mute as hell)

As always please let me know if any lines sound out of place.

All sounds (and praise) belong to Bungie and their excellent voice actors.

NOBLE ONE: Freedy Bosche
NOBLE TWO: Alona Tal
NOBLE THREE: Sunil Malhotra
NOBLE FOUR: Jaime Hector
NOBLE FIVE: Hakeem Kae-Kazim
NOBLE SIX (MALE): Philip Anthony-Rodriguez
NOBLE SIX (FEMALE): Amanda Philipson
