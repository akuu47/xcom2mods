strAlternateBleedout_Description = "Alternate Bleedout Mechanics: Overkill damage reduces Bleedout chance."
strAlternateBleedout_Tooltip = "Bleedout chances are now determined from a combination of the soldier's Will and any Overkill damage sustained. Compared to the standard Bleedout calculations, soldiers suffering little to no Overkill damage will have a higher chance to Bleedout rather than die immediately, while high Overkill damage will result in lower chances to survive, even for high level troops."
