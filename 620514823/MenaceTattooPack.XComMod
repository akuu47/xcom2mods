Title=Menace Tattoo Pack
Description=Mod pretty much self explanatory. Adds 7 New tattoos to the base game.
As always backup yourgame saves before installing mod.

This mod was crated for personal use as I couldnt find any tattoo mods yet that I wanted to use for my special characters. I am not a modder, but thanks to XCOM 2 Devs and their support for modding, it was relatively simple to do. So if anyone else finds this mode usefull, all the better.

I am not planning on updating this mod, however i might later add some facepaints and or tattoo packs in the future.
