This mod adds, currently, five edited parcels and two PCPs from the base game and six new plots. I plan to later add more parcel and PCP edits and originally built plots, parcels and PCPs. 

**PLEASE REPORT ANY MAP ERRORS** 

Parcels: 
Advent Recruitment Edit - A large parcel with a separate office area and more places for turrets to spawn 

Cabin Edit - A large parcel with a small building added across from the default cabin and more areas for XCOM to spawn 

Rowhomes edit - A medium parcel with two small buildings. One with an overhanging balcony over a store's back entrance with a relay objective on the roof and another one with a separate room leading to the 2nd floor entrance with a relay objective on the second floor 

Storefront edit - A small parcel with denser washing machines, so it now actually seems like a laundromat 

Shopping Center edit - A large parcel with a skybridge linking two buildings 

Plots: 
Plazas: A medium objective City Center plot with two rows of buildings and a "no man's land" of 1/2 cover plazas & parks between 

Rivers: A large objective Wilderness plot with winding rivers that take a considerable portion of the play area 

Downtown: A medium objective Town plot with a semi-dense retail sector 

Rivers_2: A Shanty plot, with a small village being surrounded by a river 

Avenue: A large objective Slums plot, with an avenue running down the center 

Cliff: A large objective Wilderness plot with a massive expanse of wilderness between XCOM and their objective
