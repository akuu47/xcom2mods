Remove the unique restrictions of grenades, medkits and armor

Are you tired of not being able to bring more than 1 type of grenade.. 
Do you sometimes feel like you want BOTH a flashbang and a smoke grenade on your soldiers? 
Do you sometimes feel like you want to bring more healing on your medic?
Do you sometimes feel like you want to pump up your frontline with more than 1 kind of armor?

then this mod is for you.. it removes the unique restrictions of these things, and lets you bring as many "unique" items of this type as you have slots for
some might say this is a bit (majorly??) overpowered, but it depends on how honest you want to play without restricting yourself to 1 of each type :)

in the XcomGameData.ini file you can enable ammo too and / or disable some of the other features.
