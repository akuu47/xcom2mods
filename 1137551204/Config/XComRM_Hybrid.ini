NormalChance = 25; 25% chance to capture an ADVENT unit via fultoning.
FriendlyChance = 50; when a double agent (or mind controlled ADVENT) successfully evacs a mission, this is their chance of becoming a recruit for XCOM.

Injury = 2; //a unit's lost HP is multiplied by this. So an advent captain that started with 12 HP, then got fultoned at 1 HP, would have a 47% chance to be captured with the default of 2.
