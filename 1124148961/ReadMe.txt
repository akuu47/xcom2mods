Provides True Concealment for WOTC using its built in options.

The wait is over! Get True Concealment's functionality now, thanks to built in features in WOTC! No longer will you have to deal with timers starting right away on missions - stay in concealment, and you don't have to worry about the clock ticking down. Applies to all base game and WOTC missions where timers and concealment begin at mission start.

Post-concealment turn counts:
Recover Item - 6 turns
Hack Workstation - 6 turns
Destroy Enemy Device - 6 turns
Neutralize Target - 11 turns
Rescue VIP - 11 turns

Mod will now disable the Infiltrate resistance order, which did the same thing and is now redundant.

Special thanks to:

[*] _Robbie on r/XCOM for pointing out that the timers were now controlled via .ini files

[*] Nekoworkshop, for providing the localization text that told me what Infiltrate's template name was
