Mod ID: 1471399748

In an effort to broaden the Hair variety, I come to the community with offerings! [b]73 of them!![/b] 
And I'm not alone! [b]Astery[/b] has not only helped me, but joined me in this crusade! What a mad man!

[h1]In this Pack you will find the following:[/h1]

3 Vanilla Mash-ups
4 Bandana Hair Styles
14 Short Hair Styles
12 Medium Hair Styles
11 Long Hair Styles
11 Ponytail Hair Styles
6 Braid Hair Styles
12 Astery's Hair Styles

All are tintable, all have Physics. None have fallbacks. Why wear hats and helmets, when you have fabulous new hair??!!

Please keep in mind, these are for female soldiers only. 
A separate Pack for male soldiers will be worked on.
