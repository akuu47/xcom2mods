To play:
Check the LW_LaserPack mod in the launcher. 

This mod adds a pulsed laser tier of weaponry, situated between Magnetic and Beam (Plasma) weapons on the tech tree. They generally do one additional point of damage relative to Magentic weapons, or a 50% chance of one point of damage more for laser pistols.

The basic Pulse Laser technology requires having researched Elerium technology to unlock. Advanced Pulse Lasers requires basic Pulse Laser technology to unlock. Plasma (Beam) weapons now require Advanced Pulse Lasers technology to unlock. This will have the effect of delaying plasma tier weapons because of extra research time, but the resource cost for developing lasers is comparable to magnetic weapons, so you may able to field the lasers somewhat sooner.

This includes a Pulse Laser SMG, the Pulse Stengun, which will only be playable if you also have Long War Studios' SMG mod installed.
