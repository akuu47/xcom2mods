-Initial Release

Original Description:
========================================================================================================================

MSF headgear from ground zeroes. 
Contains the balaclava, balaclava with headset, and a standalone headset, for females and males. 
If there are any errors, don't hesistate to comment, and I'll try to get them fixed. 
(although if you want me to make the balaclavas compatible with other headgear I won't do that) 


Credits to Cra0kalo for the mgsv gz file extractors 
The great people at the now defunct Kojima productions 
and last but certainly not least, Capnbubs for his great as guide to adding headwear!
