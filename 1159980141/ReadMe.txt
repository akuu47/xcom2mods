Blessings of the Elders AI Pack is a complete rework of the base game AI. The goal of the mod is to make enemies as smart as possible and to provide extra challenge to players who find the base game AI too simple. This pack covers the entire Alien troops.

-= UNIT CHANGE LIST =-
- Sectoid
- Viper (Includes Neonates from DLC)
- Muton
- Codex

-= SPECIAL CHANGES AND ADDITIONS =-
- The Gatekeeper and the Andromedon are now allowed to retreat back to other pods.
- The Andromedon and Muton can now move after using their melee attack, just like the Templar.
- Sectoid can use Psi Zombies without ending the turn.
- Viper Tongue now has a small cooldown to prevent spamming.
- Archons can now double move and hit with a melee strike.
- Chryssalids are now immune to acid.
- Chryssalids no longer burrow. Includes Neonates from TLP.
- Gatekeepers will no longer drain their own allies.
- Codices can only teleport every other round and will be forced to at least move once between teleports using regular movement.
- The Gatekeeper now has 3 AP like a Sectopod.

-= REQUIREMENTS =-
While technically not required, it goes hand in hand with ADVENT Future and Wrath of the Chosen.
The other requirements are real requirements, they are expected or units could act weird.

-= COMPATIBILITY =-
Do not use this mod with any base game retool, this pack is meant to be used with a standard WOTC installation, and some mods here and there. If you have any mods that add special enemies or changes the behavior of units, they are mostly likely not compatible.
