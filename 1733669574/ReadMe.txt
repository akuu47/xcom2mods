[h1][b]FAQ[/b][/h1]
[b][u]1. WOTC Only?? That's just a stupid zombie cash grab. Vanilla when?
- WOTC only. There will be no vanilla version coming.

[b][u]2. But... why though?[/u][/b]
- As explained before, while WOTC is indeed an expansion to XCOM 2, in terms of "under the hood",
they could very well be two different games. This presents huge complications to us modders. Each
version of the game has it's own separate 90+ GB SDK. Many, myself included, don't have the space.

Furthermore, many things changed from one to the other; new coding scripts, new texture and material
shaders, etc. So even if we did have the space for both, we can't just compile the assets in each,
and be done with it. Much needs to change with how each piece is added to the game. The assets need 
to be reworked, the textures need to be heavily altered, sometimes even start from scratch, code needs
to be rewritten, etc. I hope this clarifies why many modders have left vanilla behind.

[b][u]3. Dudes? Who uses dudes? Where's the female salon?[/u][/b]
- We got you covered right here: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1471399748

[b][u]4. Some of the beards clip through some of the faces, what gives?[/u][/b]
- Making beards requires rigging them to each face bone(there's 50+ bones). It's essentially like making 
faces, which is a huge time investment and very difficult to do. On top of that, each one would require 
a specific, individual Morph Target, to account for each face of each race. This is simply beyond our 
skill level and scope of understanding.

[b][u]5. I like many of these, but I dislike many as well. Could you give us a How-To to remove those?[/u][/b]
- Sure thing, my friend. First you'll want to navigate to the mod's Config Folder. You can find it
here: 

...Steam Games/steamapps/workshop/content/268500/PENDING/Config

Inside you will find a file named XComContent.ini. Open it, and simply place a semicolon (;) in front
of the line of the item you want the game to ignore. The line you're looking for looks like this:

+BodyPartTemplateConfig=(PartType="Hair", ......

After you're done with your magic, it'll look like this:

;+BodyPartTemplateConfig=(PartType="Hair", ......

[b][u]6. What's your To-Do list look like?[/u][/b]
- In no particular order:
Update Female Hair Pack
Update Female Clothing Pack
Face Pack
ME Squadmates

[b][u]7. I hate you and everything you stand for, but I still wanna throw some money your way. How?[/u][/b]
- Thanks! I really do appreciate it, but honestly, I do this because I love XCom, nothing more. 
Just take pictures of your squad!
